/*
 * cypress/support/auth.js
 *
 * Add commands for signing in/out from Firebase auth.
 *
 * Implementation note:
 *   We use "real" 'signInWithCustomToken' that signs up the users in Firebase Auth Emulation. 'npm run dev' has the
 *   '?user=xyz' parameter that would do the same but we don't need to go through it.
 *
 * Note:
 *   Cannot 'import' any of the application sources, since they use '/@xxx' path mapping. (This should be fine.)
 */

/*
 * 'cy.clearAuthState'
 *
 * Make sure a test starts without prior login. No access to 'firebase' is needed; thus the test does not need to do
 * 'cy.visit'.
 *
 * Note:
 *   This is needed because Cypress does _not_ clear IndexedDB between tests. The whole discussion about how state
 *   clearing / carry-over is to be handled is still ongoing (Oct 2020; Cypress 5.3.0). The stated _idea_ is that
 *   default would "clear all" (it doesn't, currently), but test authors be given control about which parts they
 *   want cleared, which not. Makes sense.

/*
 * 'cy.signAs'

/*
 * Provide the auth handle that the _app itself_ has.
 *
 * This seems to be required, in order to steer its user login/logout behaviour.
 *
 * Note:
 *   Tried also creating our own auth handle, so there wouldn't be any awareness of Cypress in the 'dev' bootup code,
 *   but that's not enough. The auth handle "works", but unrelated to the UI, thus - being pointless.
 *
 * Note:
 *   If we need access to any source code side things, this is how to get them. We cannot 'import' since the source
 *   uses '/@xyz' module redirects that Cypress doesn't know of.
